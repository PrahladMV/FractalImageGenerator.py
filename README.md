## Program Description
The Fractal Image Generator creates a fractal pattern by recursively subdividing a rectangle into smaller rectangles. The level of detail in the fractal is controlled by the recursion depth.

## Features
- Dynamic fractal generation with adjustable recursion depth.
- Real-time display using Pygame.
- Interactive program with a graphical user interface.

## Prerequisites
To run this program, you need to have Python installed along with the Pygame library.

You can install Pygame using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python fractal_image_generator.py
   ```

## Usage
- Launch the program by running the Python script.
- The fractal image will be generated and displayed in a Pygame window.
- Close the window to exit the program.

## File Descriptions
- `fractal_image_generator.py`: The main Python script that generates and displays the fractal image.

## Credits
- Program designed and developed by Prahlad.

Enjoy exploring the fractal patterns!
